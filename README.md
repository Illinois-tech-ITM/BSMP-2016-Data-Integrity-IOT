# WindowLatch

to remount this project, you should mount the circuit acording to the Diagram and conect each device in the same wired network
  
    -upload the code Server_Ethernet_Coments.ino to the other Arduino Device
  
    -run the Server and get the ip of the Device
  
    -change the IP of the server in the Code of the Client_Ether_Led.ino
  
    -upload the code Client_Ether_led.ino to the arduino conected to the leds and to the sensor.
  
to run the test of the HandShaking
  - all the same Steps of the original projec changing only the client code to the Client_Ether_led_Error_handshaking.ino
      
      -do not forget to change the IP of the server in the code.
